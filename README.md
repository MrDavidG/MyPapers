# MyPapers
This is a management system for papers. You can add comments, tagging papers and edit papers. This version is implemented in python 2.7. I will keep updating this management.

## Command Line
you can type 'help' for help information, and the command is listed as follows

  open -id [id] -n [name]

  del -id [id] -n [name] 
  
  add
  
    path:[path]
    
    name:[name]
    
    author_1: [author1]
    
    author_2: [author2]
    
    author_3: [author3] "type 'quit' if the author is done"
   
   select [name] from [tag]
